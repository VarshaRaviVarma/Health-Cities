# Health-Cities

As cities increasingly feel the effects of climate change, we need better technological solutions to improve environmental resilience. At the Healthy Cities Lab in Indiana Universityâ€™s School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, we use data science, environmental sensing, and HCI and design methods across various domains such as climate science, public health, and urban design in order to help mitigate the effects of climate change.

## Research mission:

Monitoring Heat Stress through Environmental Sensing.

Global health: We compare and analyze environmental data in Bloomington, Indiana with historical temperatures in the region to study Climate Change.

Human health: We study environmental factors, especially episodes of extreme heat, and how they affect human health.

Local awareness: This work will deliver real time environmental information to stakeholders such as governmental officials, urban farmers, and vulnerable populations.
